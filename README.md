## I. Understanding the Visitor Design Pattern: 
- falls under the behavioral design pattern category
- It allows for the addition of new operations to a set of objects without modifying their classes
- The pattern achieves this by defining a separate visitor interface or class that encapsulates the operations, and objects accept visitors to perform those operations
 
## II. Key Features of the Visitor Design Pattern:
- [Visitor] 
     - The visitor interface or abstract class 
     - declares visit methods for each element type that can be visited
     - Each visit method represents a specific operation or algorithm.
- [Concrete Visitors] 
     - Concrete visitor classes implement the visitor interface or extend the visitor abstract class
     - Each concrete visitor provides the implementation for the visit methods to perform specific operations on the elements.
- [Element] 
    -  The element interface or abstract class declares the accept method
    -  which accepts a visitor as an argument.
    -  This method enables the visitor to access and operate on the element.
- [Concrete Elements] 
    -  Concrete element classes implement the element interface or extend the element abstract class. 
    -  They provide the implementation for the accept method, allowing visitors to perform operations on them.

## III. Advantages of the Visitor Design Pattern:
- [Separation of concerns] 
     - The Visitor pattern allows the separation of algorithms or operations from the objects they operate on
     -  It promotes cleaner and more maintainable code by encapsulating related operations in visitor classes.
- [Extensibility] 
     - New operations can be added easily by implementing new visitor classes
     - Elements can accept new visitors without modifying their structure, making it straightforward to introduce new functionalities.
- [Open/Closed Principle] 
    -   The pattern follows the Open/Closed Principle by allowing the addition of new operationsthrough visitors without modifying the existing element classes.
- [Improved maintainability] 
    -  The Visitor pattern promotes code modularity and maintainability by keeping related operations together in visitor classes, making it easier to understand, modify, and test the codebase.

## IV. Conclusion : 
- The Visitor design pattern provides a flexible and extensible way to add new operations to existing objects without modifying their structure
- In Java, the Visitor pattern can be applied in scenarios where operations need to be performed on a set of objects with different types
- By utilizing the Visitor pattern effectively, you can achieve loose coupling, improved code maintainability, and extensibility, ultimately enhancing the flexibility and modularity of your codebase.
